Questions for Luca: 3/29/11
---------------------------

1. Why do we want to try to improve individual performance instead of supporting group performance?

2. You have tucked the value proposition argument into a sub-argument, but it is the leading argument in the interact version.  Do you think it is not the correct frame for DSS?

3. You say this: 

"[some researcher think] that [users of collaborative argumentation] can cope with their cognitive gaps relying on some form of collective intelligence made available through the collaborative process supported by the tools."  

I think this point is right, and I think you are trying to further justify the investigation into individual performance before moving into the study group performance. So - do you have examples where researchers have done what you say (I guess Mark does it - who else?).  Is there evidence that emergent collective intelligence doesn't happen? And, more critically, can you articulate why supporting individual intelligence is good first step in trying to support collaborative decision making / collective intelligence?  What does one have to do with the other?

I am playing devil's advocate here a little bit because I want to hear how you articulate things.
