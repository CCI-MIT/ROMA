Case Study Design - 4/21/2011

1. Research questions

As an explanatory study:

- Why (and a what point) do users who approach the site decide participate?

- Why do some users choose to be more involved than other users? --> necessitates a multi-case investigation

- What differentiates users who choose different levels of involvement? --> necessitates a multi-case investigation

Propositions / theories:

The site presents users with a value proposition.  This value proposition changes as the user engages with the site, and this will probably determine the degree to which an individual decides to engage in different levels of activity:


1.Initial participation.

- Recommendations by peers / trusted information sources.
- How much interest in climate change issues
- How much time the user has to engage in climate change related activity (e.g. time working in the CoLab vs. time doing other things).
- Initial assessments of site viability (MIT, initial appeal of messaging)
- Curiousity (possibly stemming from confusion about site)

- Enthusiasm to participate in climate change issues
- Belief that the activities on the site have a chance of making a real difference
- Belief that MIT has a chance of making a real difference

2. Continuing participation

- Desire to learn more about the issues / impression that the colab can provide such info
- New information for users
- Belief that the activities on the site have a chance of making a real difference
- Belief that MIT has a chance of making a real difference

3. Increased levels of participation

- Belief that the activities on the site have a chance of making a real difference


-- Construct validity

1. Levels of participation
2. Degrees of value / engagement / enthusiasm

Hi - 

I've been reading though Roger Yin's book, looking over our data, and met with Stephanie Woerner yesterday.  Here are my findings thus far:

- It is not usually the case that one does interviews *before* designing the case study.  According to Yin, and reinforced by my conversation with Stephanie, the research goals of the study should be clarified and initial theory developed before the procedure is defined. This is going to complicate the study.

- There may be different ways to slice our data, but stephanie thought the absence of people that completed plans that didn't "pass the bar" was problematic.  I agree and think that we should also have better representation from those that didn't quite complete plans.  I've identified a bunch of candidates for interviews and am contacting them.

- Stephanie emphasized the importance of having transcripts - not paraphrased interviews.  I've done a little looking around - with a 6-day turn around, castingwords.com is $90/hr.  I'm not sure how many hours of transcript we have, but I estimate 9 after I do another 3 interviews.  Can we do this?

As I get myself in position to do this, I realize this is a *monumental* task.  I'm up for it, but it will be challenging.

As for more substantive thinking - I'm thinking of this as a explanatory / descriptive case study with an embedded single case design, where the multiple interviews serve as a lens on the single case of the climate collab.  I think this is the right way to do this for several reasons - one being that we really want more interviews if we were to do a multiple case study (of individuals), and another being that we can use quantitative usage data to stich our interviews together and reflect upon the site.

My working research questions, based upon our interview questions and my analysis of the literature are:

- Why (and a what point) do users who approach the site decide participate?

- Why do some early adopters choose to be more involved than others and what differentiates them?

- How does the novelty of a particular web technology impact the the decision to participate and level of involvement?  (this could bear some rephrasing)

I'm am still developing a working theory, but I am focusing on the value proposition. In a very fuzzy way, I'm thinking that a value proposition is *not* static, but changes as individuals work with a site, and that different factors become more or less important as users approach and begin to work with an online community.

Here is some initial text intended to provide a framing for the paper. This is just a stab; I'm not really thinking about this as text in the actual paper right now, but it may become that.

"A growing body of literature describes the care and feeding of the communities that drive social media.  Within this literature, there has been a particular focus on the question of how participants moves along a continuum from passive observer to active and productive members of a community. But comparatively little focus has been devoted to the factors that inspire early adopters to participate before a community has been formed.

In this study, we analyze early adopters of a community driven application called the Climate Colab in order to elucidate the factors a that weigh in a decision to participate and at what level. A unique aspect of our analysis is that the CoLab embodies a novel genre of web application, and so early adopters have little foreknowledge about the type of work or level of commitment required. Our analysis should be of particular value to others that seek to harness virtual communities to accomplish substantive goals."

I am going to continue to move forward with this as quickly as possible, but would really appreciate some feedback about the transcription question, and of course any other input you might have.  

Thanks,
Josh



I.  Introduction

There are a lot of things that go into the care & feeding of community for social media, e.g.:

(loosely based on Kraut & Resnick)
- Value proposition
- Social proof: Activity begets activity
- Norms & Reputation: Techniques for driving 
- : Managing community to drife
- Tasks

These aspects are often examined within the context of existing communities, but there is a dearth of information about what motivates people to
